# PHP-FTP-Manager
The PHP FTP Manager Package (class) is intended/built to be used as a wrapper for accessing and manipulating data on FTP Servers. It extends the PHP FTP class and combines all the functions for connecting to and manipulating files and directories such as ftp_mkdir(), ftp_connect, ftp_login, ftp_get and so on into a single class.
